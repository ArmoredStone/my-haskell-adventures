## Installing Haskell complier and tools.

Recommended to use GHCup tool for installation of complier and tools.
At the moment toolchain consists of:
GHC - Glasgow Haskell Complier
cabal-install - Cabal installation tool for managing Haskell software
Stack - cross-platform tool for managing Haskell software
HSL - Haskell Language Server - a language server for IDE integration

For up to date toolchain and installation methods refer to https://haskell.org/


## compile with ghc

```
ghc hello.hs
```

Complier will generate 3 files:
1. hello.exe - final executable generated by complier, a binary file that can be run directly.

2. hello.hi - file containing interface information for Haskell modules. Complier stores information about the exported functions, types and other entities in the module.

3. hello.o - Intermediate files produced by the complier with machine code. They are not executable but used to link Haskell code to final executable. 

## use by loading module in ghci
```
ghci
ghci> :l hello
ghci> main
```

These commands would load the module in interactive environment and call the defined function.
